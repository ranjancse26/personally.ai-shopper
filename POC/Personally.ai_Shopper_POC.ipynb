We ordered the clam chowder, fried seafood platter, steamed\\nclams and seafood pasta. The clam chowder was decent and so was the fried\\nseafood platter, but the steamed clams were absolutely the best! I think I\\nfound my new favorite seafood spot.

We ordered the clam chowder, fried seafood platter, steamed\\nclams and seafood pasta. The clam chowder was decent and so was the fried\\nseafood platter, but the steamed clams were absolutely the best! I think I\\nfound my new favorite seafood spot. The portions are huge and decently priced,\\nabout $18-20 per entree. Apparently this is a chain with three different\\nlocations.
